RPPB Units Martyred Screen

After playing civilization 6 for hours and hours, one day was hit by demon of modding.I wanted to do something for the game which I have been enjoying a lot.
Modding was the way I found where I could contribute to the civilization game, thanks to firaxis for mod community.So after researching,learning, 
understanding game events and spending days and days in coding, I finally bring to you RPPB Units Martyred Screen.

Units Martyred Screen is a mod which will give you details about units who have sacrifice their life for protecting its civilization.
UMS screen will give details about the units you have lost and the units you have killed during your gameplay with each unit grouped in sophisticated manner.
In addition to it you have logs about the units who are killed by any civilization throughout the gameplay.

Besides this the mod contains another bonus screen known as Global War Screen.So for someone with aggressive style of gameplay ,this screen will not only help him to be proud of victories over wars he has fought 
and brag about it but also will give you details about the war effects like units lost in war.
Plus the screen provides you with history about the wars that have taken place throughout the game along with the wars logs.
In addition the screens will show you details about current units,military budget, military strength etc.
This mod is really helpful for aggresive style gameplay and also who loves to see different records and stats.
